# robotics

This is a robotic project for both path planning and task assignment in the warehouse.

## Demo global in Task assignment and A\* path planning**

To see a demo of the code, run the file demo.py. You can change the situation by editing example Situation. Further work have been given on A* algorithm in the correspond
ding folder.

If you use python and vscode, just generate the conda environment and select the corresponding python to run the code.

```cmd
Your_Path_to_Python robotics/robotics/demo.py
```



## Demo A\* Application in Java

To visualize the simulation results depicted in the poster within both a cubic maze and a two-dimensional plane, it is imperative to execute the code within a Java environment.

Within the Dynamic Planning module, there exist two simulation directories. The first, denominated "Manhattan Distance," encompasses simulations within a cubic maze. The second, labeled "A_star_Algorithm_2D," comprises simulations in a two-dimensional space, aiming to emulate more intricate scenarios of A* algorithm application.

To execute the model, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is essential. The installation process is facilitated by Visual Studio Code (VSCode), guiding users through the installation steps. It is critical to ensure that the JVM is installed on the local machine, rather than on a server or within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Commonly, users encounter issues when the JVM is installed in the latter environments, leading to prolonged troubleshooting efforts.

Within each simulation folder, a primary entry file can be located. This file serves as the main interface where users can define parameters such as obstacle configurations, map dimensions, as well as the starting and destination points for the simulation.
